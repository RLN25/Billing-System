## Overview

Welcome to the "RLN Groceries" project, a Python-based billing system. This project is currently under development and aims to provide a robust, user-friendly solution for managing bills in various business settings, such as supermarkets and retail stores. The system allows you to create itemized bills, apply discounts, and offer a seamless shopping experience to your customers.

## Key Objectives

- **User-Friendly Billing**: The project focuses on creating an intuitive billing system that simplifies the process for both cashiers and customers.

- **Itemized Billing**: It enables you to add items with their names, quantities, and prices, generating detailed itemized bills.

- **Error Handling**: The project prioritizes robust error handling to ensure accurate input of quantities and prices, preventing data entry mistakes.

- **Discount Options**: It aims to offer flexible discount options, allowing you to specify a discount percentage for customer bills.

- **Clear Formatting**: The system will present bills in a visually appealing and organized format for better readability.

- **Loyalty Program**: The project plans to include a loyalty program, rewarding loyal customers with points based on their total bill amount, encouraging repeat business.

## Current Status

As of now, the project is a work in progress. The code is being actively developed, and additional features and improvements are planned. Here's the current state of the project:

- The project provides a foundation for creating bills, handling itemized lists, and basic discount calculations.

- User interfaces and advanced features are still under development.

- We encourage contributions and suggestions to help enhance the project and make it a more robust billing solution.
